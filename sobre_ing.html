        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>What it is?</h2>
        <p>
            The flip-flop, also called slipper, underlay or Flat Sandals, is 
            a type of sandal typically used as a form of article of clothing. 
            It consists of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y shaped 
            strap that passes between the first and second toes and around 
            both sides of the foot or can be a hard base with a strip 
            around all fingers.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The first evidence of the use of flip-flop was in Egypt, 
            in the year 4000 BC, made of papyrus, fibers or straw 
            fastened to the feet by strips of raw leather. They used 
            them to protect their feet on scorching ground, tan the 
            top of their feet and women for the application of jewelry 
            and props.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is that name?</h2>
        <p>
            The term flip-flop has been used in American and British 
            English since the 1960s to describe inexpensive footwear 
            consisting of a flat base, typically rubber, and a strap 
            with three anchor points: between the big and second toes, 
            then bifurcating to anchor on both sides of the foot. 
            "Flip-flop" may be an onomatopoeia of the sound made by 
            the sandals when walking in them.
